#Create YAML spec for file via kubectl on Master node
kubectl run nginx-critical --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run -o yaml

#ssh into node01 and check kubelet is configured
ssh node01
systemctl status kubelet

#identify the config file for kubelet and view it
--config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

#verify the static pod path, denoted by staticPodPath in the file
#for the purposes of the question, this path is /etc/kubernetes/manifests

copy/paste yaml spec previously created into a yaml file in the staticPodPath

exit the node and run kubectl get pods to verify creation (nginx-critical-node01 should exist)
