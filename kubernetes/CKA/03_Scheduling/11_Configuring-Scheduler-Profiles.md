# 3.11 - Configuring Scheduler Profiles

- Schedulers can be configured manually or set up via kubeadm
- Additional schedulers can be created via yaml files, which can then be configured
with naming and identifying the "leader" of the schedulers for high-availability
setups
- Advanced options are available, but are outside the scope of the course
