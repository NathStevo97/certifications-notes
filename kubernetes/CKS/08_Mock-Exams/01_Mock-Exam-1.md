# 8.1 - Mock Exam 1

Q1:
A pod has been created in the omni namespace. However, there are a couple of issues with
it.
The pod has been created with more permissions than it needs.
It allows read access in the directory /usr/share/nginx/html/internal causing an Internal Site
to be accessed publicly.
To check this, click on the button called Site (above the terminal) and add /internal/ to the
end of the URL.
Use the below recommendations to fix this.
Use the AppArmor profile created at /etc/apparmor.d/frontend to restrict the internal site.

There are several service accounts created in the omni namespace. Apply the principle of
least privilege and use the service account with the minimum privileges (excluding the
default service account).
Once the pod is recreated with the correct service account, delete the other unused service
accounts in omni namespace (excluding the default service account).
You can recreate the pod but do not create a new service accounts and do not use the
default service account.

Q2:
A pod has been created in the orion namespace. It uses secrets as environment variables.
Extract the decoded secret for the CONNECTOR_PASSWORD and place it under
/root/CKS/secrets/CONNECTOR_PASSWORD.
You are not done, instead of using secrets as an environment variable, mount the secret as
a read-only volume at path /mnt/connector/password that can be then used by the
application inside.

Q3:
A number of pods have been created in the delta namespace. Using the trivy tool,
which has been installed on the controlplane, identify and delete pods except the ones
with least number of CRITICAL level vulnerabilities.
Note: Do not modify the objects in anyway other than deleting the ones that have critical
vulnerabilities.

Q4:
Create a new pod called audit-nginx in the default namespace using the nginx image.
Secure the syscalls that this pod can use by using the audit.json seccomp profile in the
pod's security context.
The audit.json is provided at /root/CKS directory. Make sure to move it under the
profiles directory inside the default seccomp directory before creating the pod

Q5:
The CIS Benchmark report for the kube-apiserver is available at the tab called CIS
Report 1.
Inspect this report and fix the issues reported as FAIL

---

Q6:
There is something suspicious happening with one of the pods running an httpd image in
this cluster.
The Falco service shows frequent alerts that start with: File below a known binary
directory opened for writing.
Identify the rule causing this alert and update it as per the below requirements:
1. Output should be displayed as: CRITICAL File below a known binary
directory opened for writing (user=user_name
file_updated=file_name command=command_that_was_run)
2. Alerts are logged to /opt/security_incidents/alerts.log
Do not update the default rules file directly. Rather use the falco_rules.local.yaml
file to override.
Note: Once the alert has been updated, you may have to wait for up to a minute for the
alerts to be written to the new log location.

---

Q7:
A pod called busy-rx100 has been created in the production namespace. Secure the
pod by recreating it using the runtimeClass called gvisor. You may delete and recreate
the pod.
Note: As long as the pod is recreated with the correct runtimeClass, the task will be marked
correct. This lab environment does not support gvisor at the moment so if the pod is not in
a running state, ignore it and move on to the next question.

Q8:
We need to make sure that when pods are created in this cluster, they cannot use the
latest image tag, irrespective of the repository being used.
To achieve this, a simple Admission Webhook Server has been developed and deployed. A
service called image-bouncer-webhook is exposed in the cluster internally. This
Webhook server ensures that the developers of the team cannot use the latest image tag.
Make use of the following specs to integrate it with the cluster using an
ImagePolicyWebhook:
1. Create a new admission configuration file at
/etc/admission-controllers/admission-configuration.yaml
2. The kubeconfig file with the credentials to connect to the webhook server is
located at /root/CKS/ImagePolicy/admission-kubeconfig.yaml. Note: The
directory /root/CKS/ImagePolicy/ has already been mounted on the
kube-apiserver at path /etc/admission-controllers so use this path to
store the admission configuration.
3. Make sure that if the latest tag is used, the request must be rejected at all times.
4. Enable the Admission Controller.
Finally, delete the existing pod in the magnum namespace that is in violation of the policy
and recreate it, ensuring the same image but using the tag 1.27.
