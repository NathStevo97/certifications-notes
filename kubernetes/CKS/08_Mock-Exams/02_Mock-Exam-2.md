# 8.2 - Mock Exam 2

Q1:
A pod called redis-backend has been created in the prod-x12cs namespace. It has
been exposed as a service of type ClusterIP. Using a network policy called
allow-redis-access, lock down access to this pod only to the following:
1. Any pod in the same namespace with the label backend=prod-x12cs.
2. All pods in the prod-yx13cs namespace.
All other incoming connections should be blocked.
Use the existing labels when creating the network policy.

Q2:
A few pods have been deployed in the apps-xyz namespace. There is a pod called
redis-backend which serves as the backend for the apps app1 and app2. The pod called
app3 on the other hand, does not need access to this redis-backend pod. Create a
network policy called allow-app1-app2 that will only allow incoming traffic from app1
and app2 to the redis-pod.
Make sure that all the available labels are used correctly to target the correct pods. Do
not make any other changes to these objects.

Q3:
A pod has been created in the gamma namespace using a service account called
cluster-view. This service account has been granted additional permissions as
compared to the default service account and can view resources cluster-wide on this
Kubernetes cluster. While these permissions are important for the application in this pod to
work, the secret token is still mounted on this pod.
Secure the pod in such a way that the secret token is no longer mounted on this pod. You
may delete and recreate the pod.

Q4:
A pod in the sahara namespace has generated alerts that a shell was opened inside the
container.
Change the format of the output so that it looks like below:
ALERT timestamp of the event without nanoseconds,User ID,the container
id,the container image repository
Make sure to update the rule in such a way that the changes will persists across Falco
updates.
You can refer the falco documentation Here

Q5:
martin is a developer who needs access to work on the dev-a, dev-b and dev-z
namespace. He should have the ability to carry out any operation on any pod in dev-a and
dev-b namespaces. However, on the dev-z namespace, he should only have the
permission to get and list the pods.
The current set-up is too permissive and violates the above condition. Use the above
requirement and secure martin's access in the cluster. You may re-create objects, however,
make sure to use the same name as the ones in effect currently

Q6:
On the controlplane node, an unknown process is bound to the port 8088.
Identify the process and prevent it from running again by stopping and disabling
any associated services. Finally, remove the package that was responsible for
starting this process.

Q7:
A pod has been created in the omega namespace using the pod definition file located at
/root/CKS/omega-app.yaml. However, there is something wrong with it and the pod is
not in a running state.
We have used a custom seccomp profile located at
/var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/custom-profile.json to ensure that this pod can only
make use of limited syscalls to the Linux Kernel of the host operating system. However, it
appears the profile does not allow the read and write syscalls. Fix this by adding it to the
profile and use it to start the pod.

---

Q8:
A pod definition file has been created at /root/CKS/simple-pod.yaml . Using the
kubesec tool, generate a report for this pod definition file and fix the major issues so that
the subsequent scan report no longer fails.
Once done, generate the report again and save it to the file
/root/CKS/kubesec-report.txt

Q9:
Create a new pod called secure-nginx-pod in the seth namespace. Use one of the
images from the below which has no CRITICAL vulnerabilities.
1. nginx
2. nginx:1.19
3. nginx:1.17
4. nginx:1-alpine
5. gcr.io/google-containers/nginx
6. bitnami/nginx:latest
