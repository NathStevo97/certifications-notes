# 2.2 - The 4C's of Cloud Native Security

- The 4C's of Cloud Native Security were all exploited in the previous demo:
  - Cloud:
    - The infrastructure hosting the kubernetes cluster
    - Not properly secured, allowed access to the pods on the cluster
    - Could have been resolved by introducing network firewalls
  - Cluster
    - Relates to security via the Docker Daemon, Kubernetes API, etc
    - Relates to security aspects such as:
      - Authentication
      - Authorization
      - Admission
      - Network Policy
  - Container
    - Relating to security at a container-level, restrictions can be put in place to secure containers from particular repos, user privileges, etc.
    - Aspects covered include:
      - Image restriction - Only able to run images from a particular repository
      - Supply Chain
      - Sandboxing
      - Privileged - Certain activities should require escalated privileges
  - Code
    - The application code itself
    - Sensitive data should not be exposed directly in the code
    - Not covered directly in the course, though some practices such as utilising environment variables, key vaults such as Azure and HashiCorp vault, are touched on.
