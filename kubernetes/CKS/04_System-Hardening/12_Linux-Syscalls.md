# 4.12 - Linux Syscalls

- To understand how Syscalls are made, need to understand how a process runs:
  - Kernel - Major OS component that interfaces between hardware and processes
  - Kernel can be split into Kernel and User Spaces
    - Kernel Space - OS-related applications and software e.g. drivers
    - User Space - Where applications are ran
  - When a program runs in the user space, suppose one that wants to write data to a file:
    - Applications make system calls to the Kernel Space for tasks e.g.:
      - Open a file
      - Write to a file
      - Define a variable
      - open()
      - close()
    - Tracing Syscalls:
      - `which strace`:
        - Installed by default
        - Used to inspect / provide output of the syscalls made when running a command
      - Output presented in form of:
        - `syscall(<path to executable file>, [arg 1, arg 2, ...], ...)`
      - To trace the syscalls of a running process:
        - Get process ID (PID) - `pid <process>`
        - Get Syscalls: `strace -p PID`
    - Note: the `-c` flag can be used for more detailed outputs.
