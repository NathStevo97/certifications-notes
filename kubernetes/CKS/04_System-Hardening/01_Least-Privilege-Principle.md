# 4.1 - The Principle of Least Privilege

- **Airport Analogy**
  - Consider an airport passenger, what procedure must they go through?
    - Baggage drop-off and ticket validation
    - Travel document verification
    - Security / Carry on check
    - Move to a specific departure gate; users can access other areas during this time, but some restrictions still apply.
  - This suggests that in security management for a system, there are multiple entities involved; each with their own permissions and privileges
  - Considering the privileges of each of the entities:
    - Traveller - Unrestricted access to public spaces in the airport after check-in and the designated gate
    - Baggage - Has access to the travellers documents and the airlines information
    - Security officers - can inspect the belongings of travellers in the area
    - Store employees - public and restricted areas
    - Boarding gate - access to the documents
    - Cleaners and cargo workers - access to public and certain restricted areas
    - Pilots / Flight crew - complete aircraft access and certain areas of the airport
- They have access only to the plane(s) of their airlines
- In this case, each entity has the least / minimum amount of privileges required to perform their role.
- This principle is applicable to computer systems and K8s clusters.
- Kubernetes cluster security, via the least privilege principle, can be enforced via multiple options including:
