# 9.0 - 2021 Updates

- As of September 28th 2021, some changes have been made to the CKAD exam objectives. Certain exam objectives have been expanded upon and altered. In particular:
  - **Application Design and Build:**
    - *Design, build, and modify container images*
  - **Application Deployment:**
    - *Use Kubernetes Primitives to implement common deployment strategies e.g. blue/green, canary, etc.*
    - *Use the Helm package manager to deploy existing packages*
  - **Application Observability and Maintenance:**
    - *Understand API Deprecations*
  - **Application Environment, Configuration, and Security:**
    - *Discover and use resources that extend Kubernetes (CRD)*
    - *Understand authentication, authorization and admission control*

- Some of these are already talked about in CKA, however for completions sake we'll do them here too.
