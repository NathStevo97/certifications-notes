# 2.13 - Terraform Format

- When working with Terraform, readability is very important. Good practice for example is to ensure that all equals signs are aligned.

- To format in this manner, run `terraform fmt`.
- This will automatically apply any indentations and alignments needed to make the configuration valid.
