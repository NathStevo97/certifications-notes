# 3.4 - Local-Exec Implementation

- Allows commands to be run on the local machine immediately after resource creation.
- Typically, this is in the form of triggering Ansible playbooks.
- Define the commands required in a similar manner to that of remote-exec, but remove any notion of connections.
