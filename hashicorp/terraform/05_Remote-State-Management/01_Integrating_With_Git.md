# 5.1 - Integrating with Git for Team Management

- For personal projects and testing, local terraform state will suffice.
- When working on client projects and in a team, it's likelier and easier to use a remote state; storing it in a backend within the cloud.
- Source code should always be stored in a central Git repository (Without exposing any credentials!).
