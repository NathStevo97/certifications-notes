# Overview

- When a token is created, a token accessor is also created and returned.
- This accessor is a value that acts as a reference to a token, and can only be used to carry out certain actions regarding it e.g.:
    - Look up a tokens properties
    - Look up a tokens capabilities for a particular path
    - Renew the token
    - Revoke the token

# Example Use Case

- Accessors can be used to save central services from storing and managing multiple tokens used as they can be used to renew and revoke any tokens associated with the processes
- To view the accessors: `vault list auth/token/accessors`
- For a particular tokenâ€™s accessors: `vault token lookup -accessor <token accessor ID>`
- Note: Tokens cannot be generated by using the token accessor!
