# 2.2 - Carbon Efficiency

## Global Warming vs Climate Change

- Global Warming: The long-term heating of earth's climate system, observed since the pre-industrial period.
  - Effect occuring due to human activities, mainly fossil fuel burning.
- Climate Change: Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Some shifts are natural, but human activities are often the driver.

## Climate vs Weather

- Weather: The conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time
- Climate: The conditions of the atmosphere over long periods of time
- Any changes to long-term conditions result in short-term changes.
- Example: If the average atmosphere temperature increases, the average temperature of the weather will also increase.
- Examples of measurable changes to weather conditions due to climate change include:
  - Changes to water cycles and rainfall
  - Icecaps melting
  - Land, air and ocean heating
  - Ocean currents, acidity and salinity changes.

- A lot of the changes can lead to flooding in coastal and rural areas; the latter via increased rainfall. Drought, wildfires and more frequent extreme conditions may also occur.

## Greenhouse Gases and the Greenhouse Effect

- Greenhouse gases: A group of gases that trap heat from solar radition in the Earth's atmosphere.
- The gases act as a blanket, increasing earth's surface temperature.
- This is a natural phenomenon that is being accelerated due to carbon emissions, the acceleration is now at a afaster rate than animals and plants can adapt to.
- The grenhouse gases and effect are essential for life on earth, and typically comes from natural sources such as animals and geological activity.
  - The effect allows earth to have a higher temperature than it would via solar radiation alone, but it must be managed appropriately.

## Carbon and CO2eq

- Carbon acts as a broad term to cover the impact of all types of emissions and activities relating to global warming.
- CO2eq/CO2-eq/CO2e = Carbon equivalence - the term used to measure impact.
- Example: 1 ton of methane = 84 tons of CO2 over 20 years, it is therefore 84 tons CO2eq.

## Monitoring Climate Change

- To try and mitigate the effects of climate change, some agreements and events have been arranged, a summary follows:

### The Paris CLimate Agreement

- An international treaty agreed in 2015 by 196 parties and the UN to reduce earth's temperature increase.
- It aims to keep the rise between 1.5 - 2 degrees celsius.
- The agreement is reviewed every 5 years and mbobilizes finance to developing nations to mitigate climate change impact for them, as well as prepare them for extreme situations.
- Each party updates their progress via a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

## United Nations Framework Convention on CLimate (UNFCCC)

- A group created to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.

## Conference of Parties (COP)

- An annual event involving all parties in the UNFCCC.
- Each party's progress on tackling global warming as part of the Paris Climate agreement is reviewed and assessed.
- Further actions and strategies for reducing emissions and supporting low-carbon options are discussed and agreed.

## Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

- Created by the UN to provide governments at all levels with with scientific information to help develop climate policies.
- Provies reports into international climate change negotiations.
- An organization of governments that are members of the UN or the World Meteorogical Organization (WMO).

## Summary

- Greenhouse gases are a group of gases contributing to global warming. Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of all types of emissions and activities on global warming. CO2eq is a measurement term used to measure this impact.
- The international community, in groups such as the UNFCCC, has come together to limit the impact of global warming by reducing emissions, aiming for a 'preferable' lower limit of 1.5&deg;C.
  - This was agreed through the UN IPCC in 2015 in the Paris Climate Agreement and is monitored at the regular COP event.
- Everything we do emits carbon into the atmosphere, and our goal is to emit the least amount of carbon possible.
  - This constitutes the first principle of green software: carbon efficiency, emitting the least amount of carbon possible per unit of work.
