# 6.1 - Introduction

- The measurement principle: what you cannot measure, you cannot improve

- The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol is the most commonly-used method for organizations to measure their total carbon emissions.
- Understanding GHG scopes and how to measure your software against industry standards will help you see to what extent you are applying Green Software principles and how far you have to go to improve.

- To complement the GHG protocol, you can also use the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification.
- While the GHG is a more generic measurement suitable for all types of organizations, the SCI is specifically for measuring a rate of software emissions and designed to incentivize the elimination of those emissions.

- The GHG is a protocol to measure total emissions, the SCI is a tool to enable the elimination of software driven emissions.
