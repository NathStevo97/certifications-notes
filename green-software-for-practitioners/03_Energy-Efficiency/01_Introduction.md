# 3.1 - Introduction

- The energy efficiency principle is simple: **Use the least amount of energy possible**

- Energy = Ability to do work
- Multiple forms of energy exist and can each be converted to another in some form e.g. chemical to electrical conversion happens during coal burning.
- In the example above, electricity is the secondary energy converted from another type; this allows measurement of electricity usage.

- All software consumes electricity, the best way to reduce consumption and subseqeuent carbon emissions is to make applications more efficient.

- Additionally, green software practitioners take responsibility for the energy consumed by their products, and design them to consume as little as possible by default.
  - At every step of the process, the waste between steps should be minimised and efficiency should be maximised.

- The final area of consideration is the user, how can, when they're running the application, minimise their unnecessary emissions.
  - This is managed by how the application is designed, such as batching jobs together.
