# 4.1 - Introduction

- The Carbon Awareness Principle: Do more when the electricity is cleaner, and less when it is dirtier.

- Electricity is production comes with a lot of variability per method e.g.:
  - **Locations** - where is it produced?
  - **Time** - when is it produced?
  - **How** - what source is used to produce it?

- Emission rates typically vary depending on the source e.g. clean, renewable sources like solar offer little carbon emissions in comparison to fossil fuels.
- Carbon awareness is the idea of doing more when more energy comes from low-carbon sources, and doing less when more energy comes from high carbon sources.
