#Create the pods
kubectl run nginx-resolver --image=nginx

#expose the pod as a service
kubectl expose pod nginx-resolver --name=nginx-resolver-service --port=80

#Now need to test nslookup against pod and service names using a busybox pod and record the results in separate files

kubectl run test-nslookup --image=busybox:1.28 --rm -it -- nslookup <pod/service name>

#If the command/lookup is successful, will see output and the pod will be deleted
