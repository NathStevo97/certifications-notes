# 3.0 - GDPR Responsibilities

## 3.1 - Data Controllers and Processors

- Data Controllers
  - Authority which alone or jointly determines the purposes and means of processing personal data
  - Tasks include:
    - Ensure they have compliance
    - Inform (data details)
    - Implement technical measures
    - Adhere to written agreements with processors
  - Data controllers must obtain data fairly and must only keep it for its intended purpose

- Data Processors
  - Authority which processes personal data on behalf of the controller e.g. a managed service
  - Tasks include:
    - Record processing operations
    - Implement Security Measures
    - Inform controllers of any data breach
    - Appoint a data protection officer (DPO) as required
  - Any data processed must be protected, processed only with sufficient permission, etc.

- Data controllers are the owner of the given data, it's responsible to the citizens, and utilises technical measures and processes when handling the data.
- Data processor follows any instructions of the controller and responsible only to the controller. It primarily utilises security functions.

- **Example: Explore California**
  - Employees share personal data with the company.  Explore california is therefore the data controller. If they then internally handled processing, the company is both the controller and processor.
  - If the company was to use a HR tool external to the company, that tool would be the processor.

## 3.2 - Joint Controllers and Third-Party Partners

- Joint Controllers
  - AKA Co-Controllers: 2 or more controllers that jointly determine how and why data is processed.
  - Example: A facebook page associated with a given company. Facebook and the company determine what is to be done with the data.
  - Characteristics:
    - Shared purpose
    - Each controller is responsible for compliance
    - Agreement with clear responsibilities for each component must be clearly outlined

- Third Parties
  - Any other parties with whom you share personal data that can process it for their purposes
  - Organizations must ensure any third parties adhere to compliance when processing third party data - this can be achieved by multiple methods:
    - Providing the third party with security prerequisite requirements
    - Carrying out regular vendor risk assessments
    - Reviewing third-party self-certifications for verification
    - Utilising independent Internal and External Audit Functions

## 3.3 - Data Protection Officer (DPO)

- Determines how well an organisation can adhere to GDPR
- Responsibilties include:
