# Understanding Cloud Computing

## Setting up an AWS Account

- [aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com) ‚Üí Create AWS Account
  - Add root email address and account name
- Verify the email address
- Create root user password
- Add contact information and account information e.g. address and name
- Add payment details
- Confirm identity via SMS or call.
- Select support option (free will suffice)
- Go to AWS Management Console ‚Üí Root User ‚Üí Login

### Set Up Billing Alerts

- Account dropdown ‚Üí Billing management
- Budgets ‚Üí Create budget ‚Üí Create from template (if desired)
  - Fill out fields as appropriate.

## Traditional Data Centres

- Consider a company not on the cloud:
  - They focus their application release in the US first, in US-based datacentres
  - They want to launch in Asia and Europe and require funding to have infrastructure built there to support the needs
  - Resources needed include:
    - Web servers
    - File servers
    - Database servers
- Manually setting all this up for each region is long, arduous, and error-strewn.
- Further problems arise when demand scales in any of the pre-existing regions.
- Moving to cloud resolves all of these problems:
  - No large upfront investment and planning required
  - Use resources as required rather than full unpredictable forecasting
  - New data centres and servers can be spun up / torn down as required
  - Lower maintenance costs
  - Security and compliance burden is alleviated from the organization.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - No need for initial investment to build out a datacentre
  - Only pay for the resources used and how long they‚Äôre used for
- Economies of scale
  - AWS buys the datacentre resources on a large scale, allowing them to provision the resources on such a price - savings are passed to the customers
- No need to guess capacity - cloud computing can allow scaling on demand.
- Speed and agility increased - resources for testing and deployment can be spun up / torn down at will for minimal costs.
  - Reduces time required to maintain infrastructure
  - Reduced risk for the organisation around security and compliance
  - Provides access to emerging technologies
- No more cost for maintaining data centres - more focus on the employees and other resources
- Data can be easily switched to different regions.

üí° **Elasticity:**

The ability to acquire resources as needed and release when no longer required.

**Reliability:**

A solution‚Äôs ability to provide functionality for its users when needed.

## Types of Cloud Computing

<aside>
üí° Cloud Computing:

The on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

</aside>

### Cloud Computing Models

- Models vary based on the control users want to have over the resources
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Any servers users deploy to the cloud
  - Can be configured to our desire and users are responsible for maintenance
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - A service preconfigured and available for users
  - It can then be customised by users as appropriate e.g. Wordpress, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Any software users have access to and can use
  - Users do not need to consider or maintain the infrastructure.

### Cloud Deployment Models

- Public Cloud: Deployment to a provider like AWS
- On-Premises Private Cloud: Deployment to a cloud-like platform in a private datacenter (VMware is a common example)
- Hybrid: A combination of both e.g. cloud applications connected to a private data center.

## Cloud Computing Scenarios

## Scenario 1

- Several production workloads in its datacentre
- VMware to manage infrastructure in their data centre
- Want to use AWS and integrate it with their data center for new workloads.
- What would they be following?
  - Hybrid - Both public and private cloud used.

## Scenario 2

- Company determining whether to fund a new line of business
- Team looking to monetize a new emerging technology
- New business line requires new infrastructure
- What benefit is most relevant?
  - Increased agility and elasticity
  - Pay-as-you-go

## Scenario 3

- Insurance company
- Moving to cloud instead of colocating servers
- Want to have maximum control for security and compliance reasons
- What cloud computing model
  - IaaS - Servers can be configured as required and maintained.

# AWS Global Infrastructure

## AWS Regions and Availability Zones

- AWS Regions
  - Resource / Service deployment location as geographic regions
  - Each geographic location has a cluster of data centres
- Availability Zones
  - A zone of one or more data centres
  - Multiple availability zones are included per AWS region
  - All located within the geographic area of the AWS region (sub-regions effectively)
  - Have redundant power, networking and connectivity for disaster recovery / high availability purposes.
- Example - US has 6 regions, each with at least 3 availability zones
- **Availability:** The extent to which an application is fulfilling its intended purpose. Applications that are highly-available are built in a manner where a single failure won‚Äôt lessen its ability to be fully operational.

### Region and Availability Zone Naming

- Example: us-east-2a
- **Format:** <AREA>-<SUB-AREA>-<NUMBER><Availability Zone Letter>

## Local and Wavelength Zones

### **Local Zone**

- Aim to place compute, storage, database, and other AWS services closer to end-users
- An extension of a particular AWS region
- Provides high-bandwidth, secure connections betwen local workloads and those running in AWS region.
  - Allows seasmless connection to the full range of in-region services through the same APIs and toolsets.

![Local Zone Example](./img/Local_Zone_Example.png)

### Wavelength Zones

- AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within communication service providers 5G networks.
- Allows application traffic from 5G devices to reach application servers without leaving the telecommunication networks.

## AWS Edge Locations

### **Points of Prescence:**

- Elements of AWS global infrastructure that exist outside of AWS regions.
- Located in or around populated areas - specific AWS services use them to deliver content to end users as quickly as possible.
- 2 Types of infrastructure per point of prescence:
  - Edge locations
  - Regional edge caches

### Edge Locations

- Used as nodes of a global content delivery network
- Primarily used by Amazon CloudFront and AWS Route 53
- Allows AWS to serve content from locations closest to users.

## Visualizing AWS Global Infrastructure

- **[Global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure)**
- Edge locations listed per region amongst other information

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1

- Looking to transfer to AWS with a few workloads
- Requirement to store backup data in multiple geographic areas
- What element of AWS Global Infrastructure will help best?
  - AWS Regions - Regions are geographical areas e.g. could store data in one and run the applications in another.

### Scenario 2

- Content served across the world
- Wanting to optimize performance to users worldwide
- Want to leverage a content delivery network
- What element is best suited to help this from AWS infrastructure?
  - Edge Locations

### Scenario 3

- Legacy applications transitioning to AWS
- 99.5% uptime required
- Don‚Äôt want issues at single datacentres to cause outages
- What element of the global infrastructure will help?
  - Availability zones

# Understanding Cloud Economics

## Economics of the Cloud

- **Capitalized Expenditure (CapEx):**
  - Upfront costs or investments to attain a fixed asset
  - Example for building a datacenter would be the building, servers, etc.
- **Operating Expenditure (OpEx)**
  - Day-to-day business activities
  - Example being maintenance costs

### Handling Demand in Data Centre

- As application usage grows, data centres need to grow with it in capacity
- When first launched, there would be a lot of unused capacity
- Eventually, demand would exceed capacity ‚Üí data centre capacity needs to be increased
- In terms of CapEx vs OpEx
  - CapEx starts out large due to initial acquiring
  - OpEx maintained at generally consistent levels.
  - Any time the capacity needs to be increased, CapEx goes up.

![CapEx vs OpEx](img/CapEx_OpEx.png)

### Handling Demand in the Cloud

- Companies in the cloud can ensure the capacity is always ‚Äújust enough‚Äù to ensure the demand is met
- As the cloud resources are being leveraged, there is no CapEx costs, instead, the OpEx costs vary depending on the application usage adn the demand.

### Financial Implications

| Own Data Centre                                                  | Cloud Infrastructure                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large CapEx                                                      | No upfront investment                                                   |
| Potential for under used capacity or unmet demand                | Pay as you go for infrastructure (OpEx)                                 |
| Increasing capacity takes time and additional investment (CapEx) | Capacity scales to meet user demand and can be immediately provisioned  |
| Monthly costs will map to predicted infrastructure needs         | Costs mirror usage levels - use more, pay more, use less, pay less etc. |
