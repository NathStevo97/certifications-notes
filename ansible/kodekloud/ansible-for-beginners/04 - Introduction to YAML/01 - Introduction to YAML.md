# Notes

- All Ansible Playbooks are written in YAML
- Text or Configuration files
- Analagous to the likes of JSON and XML, YAML is just another way of representing data

---

- Generally, data is presented in key-value pairs i.e.
- Key-Value Pair:

```yaml
key1: value1
```

- Arrays:
    - - indicates an element of an array

```yaml
array1:
- key1: value1
- key2: value2
```

- Dictionaries:
    - All entries in a particular dictionary offset by a set amount of spaces.

```yaml
dictionary:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2

dictionary2:
  key1: value1
```

- Spacing determines what data is a property of which, any values that are child properties of a particular parent must have the same amount of spaces before definition.
- Note:
    - You may have a need to store different sets of information for a particular “thing”.
    - Dictionary within dictionaries are used for using multiple values of different types
    - Arrays used for different values of the same types
    - Use a list of dictionaries for storing the same set of information for multiple entries of similar nature. In the example below, each element in the array is in fact a dictionary.
    
    ```yaml
    Fruits:
    - Banana:
        calories: value
        fat: value
        carbs: value
    - Grape:
        calories: value
        fat: value
        carbs: value
    ```
    
- When to use dictionaries v lists:
    - Dictionary = Unordered data
    - List = Ordered

    ## Exercises
    
    1. Given a dictionary with the property `property1` and value `value1`
    
    Add an additional property `property2` and value `value2`.
    
    ```yaml
    property1: value1
    property2: value2
    ```
    
    1. 
    
    Given a dictionary with the property `name` and value `apple`. Add additional properties to the dictionary.
    
    | Key/Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | apple |
    | color | red |
    | weight | 90g |
    
    ```yaml
    name: apple
    color: red
    weight: 90g
    ```
    
    1. 
    
    A dictionary `employee` is given. Add the remaining properties to it using information from the table below.
    
    | Key/Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | john |
    | gender | male |
    | age | 24 |
    
    ```yaml
    employee:
        name: john
        gender: male
        age: 24
    ```
    
    1. Now try adding the address information. Note the address is a dictionary
    
    | Key/Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | john |
    | gender | male |
    | age | 24 |
    | address | Key/PropertyValuecityedisonstatenew jerseycountryunited states |
    
    ```yaml
    employee:
        name: john
        gender: male
        age: 24
        address:
          city: edison
          state: new jersey
          country: united states
    ```
    
    1. Given an array of apples. Add a new apple to the list to make it a total of 4.
    2. add two more
    3. add two mangoes to the list
    
    ```yaml
    - apple
    - apple
    - apple
    - apple
    - apple
    - apple
    - mango
    - mango
    ```
    
    1. 
    
    We would like to add additional details for each item, such as color, weight etc. We have updated the first one for you. Similarly modify the remaining items to match the below data.
    
    | Fruit | Color | Weight |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | apple | red | 100g |
    | apple | red | 90g |
    | mango | yellow | 150g |
    
    ```yaml
    -
        name: apple
        color: red
        weight: 100g
    - name: apple
      color: red
      weight: 90g
    - name: mango
      color: yellow
      weight: 150g
    ```
    
    1. We would like to record information about multiple employees. Convert the dictionary `employee` to an array `employees`
    
    ```yaml
    employees:
    -   name: john
        gender: male
        age: 24
    ```
    
    1. Add an additional employee to the list using the below information.
    
    | Key/Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | sarah |
    | gender | female |
    | age | 28 |
    
    ```yaml
    employees:
        -
            name: john
            gender: male
            age: 24
        - name: sarah
          gender: female
          age: 28
    ```
    
    1. 
    
    Now try adding the pay information. Remember while `address` is a dictionary, `payslips` is an array of `month` and `amount`
    
    | Key/Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | john |
    | gender | male |
    | age | 24 |
    | address | ... |
    | payslips | #monthamount1june14002july24003august3400 |
    
    ```yaml
    employee:
        name: john
        gender: male
        age: 24
        address:
            city: edison
            state: 'new jersey'
            country: 'united states'
        payslips:
        - month: june
          amount: 1400
        - month: july
          amount: 2400
        - month: august
          amount: 3400
    ```
