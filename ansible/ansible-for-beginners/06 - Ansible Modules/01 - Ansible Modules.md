# Notes

- Modules are categorised based on functionalities e.g
    - System - Commands based on the host system e.g. start/stop service
    - Commands - Used to execute commands or scripts on hosts
    - Files - Used to execute file-specific commands e.g. find, copy, replace
    - Database - Used to interact with databases such as MongoDB, MSSQL, MySQL
    - Cloud - Used to interact with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, Linode, Digital Ocean.
    - Windows - Commands to help use Ansible in a windows environment, be it working with files, user management, executing commands.
- This is a non-exhaustive list - many more modules can be viewed in the Ansible documentation, with details on how to use each provided.

### Command

- Used to execute a command on a remote node
- Parameters include:

- Example Playbook:

![Example playbook to execute the date command and run the cat command on a desired file.](images/command-example-1.png)

Example playbook to execute the date command and run the cat command on a desired file.

- Creates parameter is used to perform a check if the folder or file exists before running the command
- chdir requests that ansible changes directory before the command is ran
- free_form - the command module takes a free form command to run; no parameters are required
    - Not all commands support free-form parameters, example, copy requires a source and target dir to be specified.

---

### Script

- Used to run a local script on a remote node after transferring it.
- Example playbook:

### Service

- Used to manage services on the system e.g. stop, start, restart
- Example playbooks for this can be done in one of two manners:

![Service Example](images/service-example.png)

- **Question:** Why write the state as ‚Äústarted‚Äù and not ‚Äústart‚Äù?
    - Not instructing ansible to start the service, we are asking ansible to ensure that it is started i.e. if it‚Äôs not started - start it
    - This leads to the idempotency of ansible modules:
        - Idempotency - An operation is idempotent if the result of performing it once is exactly the same as the result of performing it repeatedly without any intervening actions
    - In general, Ansible‚Äôs idea is to be able to run a playbook, when running it again, everything should return ‚Äúas expected‚Äù, if not, Ansible will make it so.

---

### Lineinfile

- Searches for a line in a file and replaces it or adds it if it doesn‚Äôt exist
- Example playbook:

![LineInFile Example](images/lineinfile-example.png)

- Note that this action IN THEORY could be achieved by running a script like this:

![LineInFile Script Example](images/lineinfile-script-example.png)

- However, this would repeatedly add the same entry to /etc/resolv.conf rather than replace it or not add it if found. By contrast the idempotency of Ansible means that if this task is ran as part of a playbook, the entry is added once and only once if it‚Äôs not found.
